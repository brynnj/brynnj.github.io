# James Brynn

<p class="lead">
  Aerospace engineer focused on multibody dynamics, with a side interest in trading, simulation, and keeping up with modern tools so I don't get replaced.

  Big fan of trying things, failing fast, and learning as much as possible.

## About Me

I'm currently the Multibody Dynamics Lead at Relativity Space, working on the Terran R launch vehicle (a medium-heavy lift rocket). Most of my work is MBD and simulation, with a bit of fluid dynamics and loads here and there, and I'm very interested in the GNC/mission design realm as well as the other flight sciences disciplines and love reading about these fields. In my free time I like to mess around with algorithmic trading, AI/ML, and anything else that's hard and unlikely to actually work. This portfolio is all the side stuff that doesn't fit on the resume - a mix of algorithmic trading strategies/research/experiments, some simulation work, and various AI/ML things I've tried. 

Disclaimer - many of these projects are not "successful", and the things that actually have value I keep hidden in private repos, but if you reach out I'm more than happy to talk about anything you find interesting or want to dig deeper on.

## Background

- Multibody Dynamics Lead at Relativity Space
- B.S. and M.S. in mechanical engineering, University of Michigan.
- Computer science minor.
- Baja SAE competitor 3x, primarily on drivetrain.
