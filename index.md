## About Me

I'm currently the Multibody Dynamics Lead at Relativity Space, working on the Terran R launch vehicle (medium-heavy lift, first stage reusable).
I spend most of my time in modeling and analysis, doing my best to support the fast development of good hardware.
I focus on stage separation, fairing separation, fluid transient modeling, landing leg deployment, and touchdown.
Within the MBD team, we also cover the dynamics of transport and recovery ops.


Back in college, I learned how to design hardware on the Michigan Baja Racing team, working on drivetrain (primarily CVT).


Outside of work, I try to self-teach algorithmic trading, simulation, and applied ML.
This portfolio is *not* a mechanical engineering or dynamics portfolio, just a collection of experiments and projects that don't fit on a resume.
However, all of them have been very effective for learning about Python, software architecture, math, and new ways of thinking about risk and decision-making.
They've improved my engineering ability in some indirect ways I didn't expect.


I keep most of this in private repos, but I'm happy to talk about any of it if you have questions or are willing to offer some advice.
