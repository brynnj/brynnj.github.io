  Aerospace engineer focused on multibody dynamics, with a side interest in trading, simulation, and keeping up with modern tools so I don't get replaced.

  Big fan of trying things, failing fast, and learning as much as possible.

## About Me

I'm the Multibody Dynamics Lead at Relativity Space, focused on simulation and vehicle dynamics for the Terran R launch vehicle. I spend most of my time in modeling and analysis, and I stay curious about GNC, mission design, and other flight sciences.

Outside of work I explore trading research, simulation, and applied ML. This portfolio collects experiments and side projects that don't fit on a resume; some are exploratory, and I'm happy to discuss what worked and what didn't.
